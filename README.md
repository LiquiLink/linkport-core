# Chainlink DeFi CCIP Project

## Overview
The Chainlink DeFi CCIP project aims to facilitate cross-chain asset bridging and lending without the need for native tokens for gas fees. Users can deposit tokens on one chain and withdraw equivalent assets on another chain, leveraging Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) for seamless messaging and transactions.

## Features
- **Cross-Chain Messaging**: Utilizes Chainlink CCIP to send and receive messages between different blockchains.
- **Liquidity Pool Management**: Users can deposit and withdraw tokens from a liquidity pool, with fees calculated based on the amount borrowed.
- **Liquidation Mechanism**: Automatically triggers liquidation for users who fail to repay their borrowed amounts, ensuring the sustainability of the liquidity pool.
- **Token Whitelisting**: Maintains a whitelist of tokens that can be used for bridging and liquidity pool operations.
